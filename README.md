# Prospects and challenges of voice assistants

Voice interfaces are a futuristic tool, which is now getting more and more popular. Innovative technology specialists Dmitry Milostnov, CTO of the cloud video surveillance service Cambat.ru, and Alexander Nizhelsky, CEO of technic.ally and Leanconsult, discussed the prospects of using voice interfaces in business processes and the problems of voice assistants. 

## Business processes. 
The number of companies using voice assistants as a sales channel is growing. They can also reduce costs and operator workloads, because voice assistants can:
advise on product features, answer popular questions, place orders and get feedback from customers;
make it easier for the customer to search and reduce rejection rates - according to marketing agency Digitas, 85% of people who bought products using a voice assistant settled on the first option offered.
 To suggest the product most likely to attract a user, assistants use query history, location and other data. Juniper Research predicts that voice advertising revenue could reach $19 billion by 2022, thanks in large part to the growth of voice search apps on mobile devices.

### The "humanization" of voice assistants. 
They're learning more health-related skills rather than business-related skills. They are also learning to recognize a person's emotions and well-being. People, in turn, become emotionally attached to assistants, and voice interfaces are attributed agency - the human ability to act as an independent agent, to make informed and free choices and to act on them.

#### Why we need to be more vigilant. 
Voice assistants transmit a recording and/or text version and other data to the developer's server to execute the user's command. Once the task is completed, the company can delete them or keep them - for example, to check the quality of speech recognition. Because of this, risks arise:

The assistant may store more information than expected. Assistants should only record sound after hearing a coded expression from the owner. However, they may react to similar words and speech on TV or trigger for no reason.
Employees of the development companies may have access to personal information. People check the quality of voice assistants. They can find out personal information - such as medical history told to monitor a patient's condition in the hospital. According to The Guardian, Apple has made changes to its Siri voice assistant quality control program. Under the new rules, without user consent, contractors can no longer listen to voice commands sent by Siri users.
